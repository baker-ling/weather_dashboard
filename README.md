# Weather Dashboard
A simple weather dashboard using JavaScript, Bulma, and the openweathermap.org geocoding and one-call APIs.

The app is deployed [here](https://baker-ling.github.io/weather_dashboard/index.html).

To use the app, type in the name of a city (either just the name of the city or in the pattern 'Cleveland, OH, USA') and press the search button. The app will look up that city and show its current weather and a five-day forecast.

When you look a city, it is added to a recent cities list below the search interface. You can click on any of the cities in that list to bring it up again.
